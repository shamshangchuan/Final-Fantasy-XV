				<p><b>[Reclaim Your Throne…]</b></p>
				
								<p>Out on the road with his closest friends, Prince Noctis hears unsettling news: his homeland has been invaded and has fallen under the false pretense of a peace treaty, with his father, his fiancée, and he himself reported dead. Unsure of what to believe, he knows only one thing – he must make his way home and take back what is rightfully his.

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/noctis.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>
								
								</p>
								
			<p><b>Noctis Lucis Caelum</b></p>
								
								<p>The crown prince and heir apparent to the Lucian throne. Noctis' trials begin when he sets forth from his home of the Crown City of Insomnia with his three closest friends to wed the Lady Lunafreya Nox Fleuret in Altissia. He wields the power of the Lucian kings as well as spectral weapons he forges from thin air, a power possessed by those of his royal bloodline.

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/gladio.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>

								</p>

			<p><b>Gladiolus Amicitia</b></p>

								<p>The Amicitia family has long served as the shield protecting the kings of Lucis and their household, and Gladiolus is its eldest son. He is a childhood friend of Ignis and Noctis, with whom he shares a bond that transcends that of a bodyguard and his liege. With his prodigious strength, Gladiolus stands ever ready to keep his companions from harm and takes great pride in his role as Noctis' sworn shield.

								</p>
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/ignis.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>

								</p>

			<p><b>Ignis Scientia</b></p> 

								<p>Ignis is a close childhood friend and was raised alongside Prince Noctis. He acts as an adviser to the heir apparent and a servant of the Crownsguard, as well as the group's driver (unless the player wants to drive manually as Noctis) and chef. An intensive education instilled in him the resourcefulness and composure needed for the role, proving his tactical acumen invaluable over the course of the prince's journey.

								</p>
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/prompto.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>

								</p>

			<p><b>Prompto Argentum</b></p>

								<p>Fast friends with Noctis since they met as teenagers, Prompto is a young man of common birth who finds himself out of depth when tragedy befalls Lucis. Nevertheless, he strives to carry more than just his weight, lightening his companion's burdens as well as their spirits. He is the most playful of the four, being upbeat, and easily becomes smitten with women. He takes photos and wants to save pictures of their road trip, and is good with machines where he makes use of them as weapons in battle.

								</p>
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/lunafreya.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>

								</p>
								
			<p><b>Lunafreya Nox Fleuret</b></p>

								<p>The younger sister of Ravus Nox Fleuret and Prince Noctis' betrothed. Luna made many fond memories with Noct in their childhood, but their days of innocence ended abruptly when the empire overtook her home of Tenebrae. Through adversity, she became the youngest Oracle in history. Adored and respected by the world over, she now travels in search of communion with the gods to aid Noct on his journey.

								</p>
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/regis.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>

								</p>

			<p><b>Regis Lucis Caelum</b></p>

								<p>The reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Lucis. Regis raised his son, Prince Noctis, on his own when his mother passed away when he was still an infant. For many years, he has sustained the Wall, a magical barrier that encases the Crown City, around the metropolis protecting it from invasion using the Ring of the Lucii to channel the power of Insomnia's Crystal. However, tragedy would befall him at the treaty signing with Niflheim, during which he was reportedly slain.

								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/cor.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>

								</p>

			<p><b>Cor Leonis</b></p>

								<p>Leader of the Lucian Crownsguard, otherwise known as "The Immortal." The general spends his days in service of Noctis' father, King Regis—just as when they journeyed together thirty years ago.

								</p>
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/cid.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>

								</p>

			<p><b>Cid Sophiar</b></p>

								<p>Head honcho at Hammerhead, a premier Lucian garage located in Liede, as well as Cindy Aurum's grandfather. This handy mechanic once serviced the royal vehicle while out on the road with the King thirty years ago. Even now, at an old age, he still possesses top-notch mechanic skills and upgrades Noctis' weapons.

								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/cindy.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>

								</p>
			<p><b>Cindy Aurum</b></p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/titan.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>
							</p>
		<p><b>Titan - The Archaean</b></p>
								<p>the God of Earth who resides in Disc of Cauthess under the glowing meteorite. He is a giant who uses Gaia's Wrath to damage enemies and has a higher chance of appearing after Noctis's allies have been defeated. When summoned, Titan appears in the distance, picks up a large piece of earth, and tosses it at the enemies in Noctis's vicinity. When this lands, several gigantic pillars of earth rise from the ground to damage nearby foes.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/ramuh.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>
							</p>
		<p><b>Ramuh - The Fulgurian</b></p>

								<p>The God of Storm overseeing the natural laws of Eos. A bearded old wizard dressed in flowing robes who uses Judgment Bolt when outside a dungeon to deal heavy damage to all opponents within a wide radius. When called upon, he scoops Noctis up with his left hand and wraps his staff in lightning. He then tosses the staff at the enemies below him, triggering a massive explosion that chars the surrounding landscape. Ramuh can be summoned in almost every area and has a higher chance of appearing the longer a battle lasts.

							</p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/leviathan.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>
							</p>
		<p><b>Leviathan - The Hydraean</b></p>

								<p>The Goddess of the Seas, revered by the ocean-dwelling Sahagin, a colossal sea serpent lurking in the lightless depths in the city of Altissia as its patron deity. Though she has slumbered there since the end of the Great War of Old, the residents are wary of her for she is known for drowning and devouring all that crosses the Leviathan's path. She can only be summoned when there is a body of water nearby and only appears to Noctis when he is in danger.
							</p>
							</p>
							</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/shivah.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>
							</p>
		<p><b>Shiva - The Glacian</b></p>
								
								<p>The Goddess of Ice and the Messenger of the gods to mortals. She used to dislike humans for the fleeting nature of their lives, and how they cling to their hopes and dreams. Witnessing compassion and benevolence in others warmed her heart and became fond fond mankind. When summoned, she freezes the surrounding landscape and appears alongside several copies of herself, using her signature attack, Diamond Dust. Chances of summoning her increases for every party member in Down/Danger, including the time the player has spent in battle. Shiva needs some space to be summoned but can also be summoned nearly anywhere.
							</p>
							</p>
							</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/bahamut.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>
							</p>

		<p><b>Bahamut - The Draconian</b></p>

								<p>The God of War, and the only Astral to remain active in the wake of the Great War of Old. He appears as a giant man in dark armor with wings made out of swords. Unlike other Astrals, Bahamut is only called during Noctis's battle with the original penultimate boss. When summoned, he uses Ultima Sword, an attack that causes several massive blades to rain down on the enemy.

							</p>
							</p>
							</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://github.com/shamshangchuan/Final-Fantasy-XV/blob/main/images/ifrit.jpg?raw=true" alt="" /></span>

							</p>

		<p><b>Ifrit - The Infernian</b></p>

								<p>The incarnation of fire and fury, worshipped by the lizard-like Amalj'aa tribe. Ifrit, known as the God of Fire and a hostile Astral who plays an important role in Eos' history. In the Old Calendar Era, he betrayed the rest of his kind, caused the downfall of Solheim and began the Great War of Old. His breath ignites the very air, his claws melt the strongest steel, and his twisted horns scorch the heavens. Those who would face him must be prepared to withstand the fires of hell, and unlike other Astrals, Ifrit cannot be summoned by Noctis.
